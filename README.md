# Malware-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-
Malware detection in computers is generally divided into two types, static analysis and dynamic analysis. The same is applicable to Android OS. Static analysis deals with examining the functionality of an application/file without executing it, whereas dynamic analysis examines the file by running it in a computer (or even sandbox tools) to investigate the behaviour of the malware in depth. We will be implementing both static analysis, using a test data as well as dynamic analysis using a live malware (in Virtual machine) to test our application. We will be building a Machine Learning model to predict whether a given .exe file is a Malware or not. The antivirus is trained using 5 different machine learning algorithms and the best one is chosen after training. The trained machine learning model is then saved to test for new files. The input file or input features are classified into legitimate or malicious.
